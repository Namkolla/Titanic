# Titanic
Summary: in this analysis, I looked at the greatest predictors of survival on the Titanic. The dataset was pulled from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data. An example of an interesting observation I made in this analysis is that being a woman GREATLY increased the chance of survival on the Titanic. Being a woman increased a passenger's chance of survival by more than 2x in first class, by more than 4x in second class, and by more than 3x in third class.
